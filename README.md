# Nectaria .
An operating system, still operates itself. We are trying to make the operating system via _Linux_.

# I (Aeroized) have an idea
What about making the operating system, not system-based; like it will be an system that runs on _Windows_, _Linux_ or other ones.

# What's new? (Patch 21042025)
- 1d ago - There is just designs ready.
- 1d ago - And some bootloader files, bootloader itself too. (Yes, it is _GRUB_)
- today  - No bootloader needed, we deleted the bootloader, out of our minds.
- today  - System is made out of _Python_ (Maybe faster coding language, lile _C#_, later)
